I'm an adventure photographer living and working in Philadelphia, PA. I specialize in landscape photography of New England, including lighthouses, the Cape Cod National Seashore, and the ocean.

My interest in photography started when I was in high school. Through Boy Scouts and through my family, I was taking almost weekly camping trips all around New England, including the White Mountains, the Cape Cod National Seashore, and coastal New Hampshire and Maine. I was struck by the varied landscapes of New England and I wanted a way to capture what I was experiencing. As my adventures expanded into long backcountry hikes and skiing, I was soon carrying almost more camera gear than camping gear and I fell in love with trying to capture the feeling of being deep in the outdoors.

You can find my work at the portfolio link above.
