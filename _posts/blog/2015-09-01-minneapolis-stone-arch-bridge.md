This view is one of the most well known vistas in Minneapolis, and for good reason. I returned to this spot over and over again during the four months I spent in Minneapolis this summer. There's no defined path down to the banks of the Mississippi but it's very easy to scramble through the brambles and find a good vantage point. It's probably a good idea to check the tide tables or wear sandals, though, as I managed to soak my feet trying to find a spot to set up my tripod away from the heavy, low brush near the shoreline.
