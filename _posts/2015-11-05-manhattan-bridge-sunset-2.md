Every fall I head up to New York to meet some [NSOP](http://newschoolofphotography.com/content.php?r=2317-Photo-Expo-2015-wrap-up! "New School of Photography") friends for the PhotoPlus Expo. Most of them drive down from Rhode Island, but we still always try to cram in a sunrise or sunset shoot during the day.

This year, I headed up to New York on Thursday to work for two days before the expo. This also gave me a couple of extra days for photography and I knocked off one of my major bucket list locations: the Manhattan Bridge.

I tried to shoot from [this spot a few years ago](https://instagram.com/p/j-iwJsIfvZ/?taken-by=frigidlight) but was blocked out by the high fencing that runs along the entire bridge deck. Some time between now and then, someone has cut a huge hole through the fencing and I was able to shoot from a couple different angles as the sun was setting behind downtown Manhattan.
