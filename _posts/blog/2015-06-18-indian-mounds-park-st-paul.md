I spent a week of my summer in Minnesota staying in St. Paul. I've been to Minneapolis many times but this was my first trip to the other twin city. I only had one night to get out and shoot sunset and chose to walk across the town to <a href="http://www.stpaul.gov/facilities.aspx?page=detail&RID=53">Indian Mounds Park</a>.

One of my goals was to take a timelapse with a train moving through the shot and I missed that by a few minutes. This was still an awesome location though - cars were streaming along the riverfront road all night.
